    "You must complete the code for the `customize_tokenizer` function. The function takes the **spaCy** pipeline as input. It should updated the infixes rules of the tokenizer and return the updated version of the pipeline including the customized tokenizer. The `Tokenizer` must keep the default vocabulary and all the default prefixes, infixes and suffixes rules of the pipeline. You should only update the infixes rules adding a regular expression that captures slash (`/`) characters. The `Tokenizer` should **not** include special cases or rules for token and url matching. Check the [spacy's documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers) to learn how to customize the tokenizer."
